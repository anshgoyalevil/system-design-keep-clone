Everyone of you might have used the Keep App by Google where you can add your notes. This app works similar way, with some amazing tweeks in UI XD.

This is a complete system, with frontent (End user interface), backend (Server side logic) & database.

## Technologies used at frontend:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Tailwind
- Flowbite
- Fontawesome

## Technology used at backend:
- Node.JS

Following Node Modules are used:
- dotenv - for securing api keys
- uniqid - for generating unique ids
- express - for server side logic
- body-parser - for parsing the body data
- mongoose - for using mongodb effeciently
- express-session - for cookie sessions
- passport - for authentication
- passport-local-mongoose - passport plugin for mongoose
- passport-google-oauth20 - passport auth strategy for google authentication
- mongoose-findorcreate - a utility mongoose function

## Technology used for storing data:
MongoDB is used in this project for storing data of the users.

## Other Features:
This project used the advance session and user management system. The passwords of the users are encrypted with multi-layer salting and hashing function. It uses very high performance and low latency CRUD operations.

Note: This project contains some methods and modules, used for google authentication, though, the google authentication endpoints are not declared in this project. If you need help with implementing google authentication, feel free to ping me at anshgoyal0417@gmail.com
